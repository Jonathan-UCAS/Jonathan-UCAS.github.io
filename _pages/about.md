Hi, this is Shing-Ho from Hong Kong. 
I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [*School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)*](https://www.ucas.ac.cn) in June 2025. 
I was a visiting student at the [*School of Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)*](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/) in 2024.

Currently pursuing the Academic Masterâ€™s (MPhil) degree at the [*Institute of Information Processing, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University (THU)*](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/szdw/jsdw1/ayjscz/xxclyjs.htm), I am a member of [*The Intelligent Vision Group (IVG)*](https://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/) under the joint supervision of [Prof. Jie Zhou](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1084/1699.htm) and [Prof. Jiwen Lu](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1096/2329.htm).

Previously, my interests lay broadly in representation learning, including geometric deep learning (especially in Hyperbolic Geometry), as well as brain-inspired methods (Reservoir Computing). 
I was deeply honored to be a Principal Investigator, funded by the [*Beijing Natural Science Foundation (BJNSF)*](https://nsf.kw.beijing.gov.cn/bjnsfweb/) during my undergraduate study from 2023 to 2025.

I am extremely privileged to be the only recipient at UCAS for the *National 2nd Scholarship for Hong Kong, Macao and Overseas Chinese students* (Undergraduate, highest level at UCAS), by [Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China](https://www.moe.gov.cn).
