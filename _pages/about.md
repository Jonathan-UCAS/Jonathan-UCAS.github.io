Hi, this is Shing-Ho Jonathan Lin (call me Jonathan) from Hong Kong, currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in [*Schoolf of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)*](ucas.ac.cn). 
I had the privilege of being a visiting student at the [*Schoolf of Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)*](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/).

My interests lie broadly in representation learning, including the geometric deep learning (especially in Hyperbolic Geometry), as well as brain-inspired methods (Reservoir Computing), both having great publications. 
I am deeply honored to be a Principal Investigator, funded by the [*Beijing Natural Science Foundation (BJNSF)*](https://nsf.kw.beijing.gov.cn/bjnsfweb/) during my undergraduate study.

I have published in conferences (AAAI) and journals (Pattern Recognition). 
My participated paper has been selected as *Oral Presentation* in AAAI.
